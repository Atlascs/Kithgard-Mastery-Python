## This is My Kithgard Mastery Python Solution 

# Reach the end of the maze using move commands

## First step is pretty easy, simply write your code using the move commands to navigate your champion to the end of the maze.

# Count how many gems you pick up, and then say the current count when near a fireball trap to disable it.

## The second step is a bit harder and will require you to increment a variable and then "say" the current value at the right time.

# The raven at the start will give you a password. Say the password near a door to open it.

## Third is easy it's shown right on the screen, you just need to repeat it back near a door.

# Kill ogres when you get near them.

## This is simple combat but ti happens within a loop statement. So the nearest enemy needs to be redefined on the second loop. 

# You can use a loop to repeat all of the instructions as needed.

# If you beat this level, you can skip to the Forest World!

## You could, but coding is awesome finish the dungeon!



############################################
## First define a variable gems and set it equal to 0 (your starting amount before going through the dungeon)

gems = 0

#		Next start your "loop" and navigate the maze (you only need to do half and let the loop repeat).

loop:
    self.moveRight()
    self.moveUp()
    self.moveUp()
    ogre = self.findNearestEnemy()
    if ogre:
        self.attack(ogre)
        self.attack(ogre)
    self.moveLeft()
    self.moveUp()
    self.moveUp()
    self.moveRight()
    self.moveRight()
	gem = self.findNearestItem()
		if gem:
		self.moveUp()
			
## You have just acquired a gem so you are no longer at 0. now add 1 to it.
    gems = gems + 1
    self.moveDown()
    self.moveRight()
    self.moveDown()
    self.moveDown()
## Time to disable the trap by telling them how many gems we currently have
    self.say(gems)
    self.moveDown()
    self.moveDown()
	
## This is the password the raven gave us on the lower left hand side of the screen.
    self.say("Swordfish")
    self.moveRight()
    self.moveRight()
	
##You have now made it half way. Let the loop repeat and when it collects the next gem it will update the amount and by pass the trap.
